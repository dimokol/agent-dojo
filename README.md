# agent-workbench

Hooks, skills and an MCP server for running several coding agents at once without them
merging things you didn't approve, fighting over one checkout, or pinning your CPU. Claude Code
first; the skills and the chat server also work in Codex. Install only the parts you want.

New to running more than one agent? Start with
[Running several agents at once](docs/running-several-agents.md). It's a five-minute read.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add dimokol/agent-workbench
claude plugin install starter@dimokol   # git-guardrails, machine-pressure, worktree-hygiene, agent-chat
claude plugin install <part>@dimokol    # or pick single parts from the table
```

Then restart Claude Code. `/plugin` lists what you installed (with starter, `/mcp` also shows
agent-chat). To see one work, ask "run a health check": worktree-hygiene audits your worktrees and
disk without changing anything.

Every setting has a default. After install Claude Code may say options are "not yet set". That's
fine, the defaults apply. Change a part's settings with `/plugin configure <part>@dimokol`; each
part's README lists them. Your own hooks stay as they are. Turn a part off with
`claude plugin disable <part>@dimokol`. If you installed starter, run
`claude plugin disable starter@dimokol` first, because it holds its four parts in place.

Codex, or no plugin system: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimokol/agent-workbench/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --list`
shows the parts. To copy one into place, swap `--list` for the part's name:
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimokol/agent-workbench/main/install.sh | bash -s -- git-guardrails`.
It prints any hook or MCP snippet for you to paste. For Codex, set the skills folder:
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimokol/agent-workbench/main/install.sh | SKILLS_DIR=~/.codex/skills bash -s -- worktree-hygiene`.
In Codex the skills and agent-chat work; hooks are Claude Code only.

## Parts

| Part | What you get | Type |
|---|---|---|
| [git-guardrails](plugins/git-guardrails) | Agents can't merge PRs, push to protected branches, delete remote branches or run `reset --hard` unless you said so. Strict mode also gates every commit and push. | hooks |
| [pr-task-link-guard](plugins/pr-task-link-guard) | `gh pr create` is refused when the body has no link to a task, once you set a task-link pattern. | hook |
| [machine-pressure](plugins/machine-pressure) | Refuses a second e2e or Docker run, and heavy commands while CPU, memory or disk is in the red, plus a statusline script you add by hand. | hook, script |
| [context-nudge](plugins/context-nudge) | One line when a session passes 250k, 400k and 600k tokens, or after an hour idle at 150k or more, so you compact or start fresh. | hook |
| [worktree-hygiene](plugins/worktree-hygiene) | An audit to run at session start: merged worktrees, idle dependency folders, orphaned dev servers, free disk. Proposes, never deletes. | skill |
| [storage-reclaim](plugins/storage-reclaim) | Disk cleanup that measures first and won't touch files a process or session is using. macOS. | skill |
| [agent-chat](plugins/agent-chat) | Chat rooms for agents in different terminals, even in different repos, so they settle an API shape without you relaying. | MCP server |
| [verify-before-building](plugins/verify-before-building) | Fetches and checks the trunk before you branch, so nobody rebuilds what already merged. | skill |
| [pr-review-loop](plugins/pr-review-loop) | Asks the reviewer once, applies or answers every finding, reruns your checks, stops when the PR is ready. Never merges on its own. | skill |
| [integration-branch-qa](plugins/integration-branch-qa) | Test several approved PRs at once on one local branch that never gets pushed, with a clickable checklist and a merge gate. | skill, hook |
| [e2e-harness-patterns](plugins/e2e-harness-patterns) | A local e2e stack per worktree, so several agents can run end-to-end tests side by side. | skill |
| [setup-audit](plugins/setup-audit) | A weekly read of the Claude Code changelog plus your own drift checks, written to a log. | skill |

[blocks/](blocks) holds text to paste into your own `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`: a working
agreement between you and the agent, web project standards, a writing tone, a product copy voice,
and a docs layout.

| [claude-notifications](https://github.com/dimokol/claude-notifications) (same author) | A sound and an OS banner when a Claude Code session in a VS Code terminal finishes or needs you.

## Credits

- [ccstatusline](https://github.com/sirmalloc/ccstatusline) by sirmalloc draws the statusline that machine-pressure's widgets plug into.
- [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by Jesse Vincent shaped how these parts were planned, built and reviewed.
- [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills): its grilling skill settled the design questions, and it has a git-guardrails skill with the same aim as this one.
- [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack): its unslop skill is the stricter checklist `blocks/writing-tone.md` points to, and its worktree-cleanup is the fuller playbook worktree-hygiene points to.
